## Euler

The idea is to solve a problem from [Project Euler][1] at day.

Since a problem can have many solutions, the idea is to create a folder for every problem using the index of the problem as a folder name (eg `1` for the first problem and `15` for the fifthteen problem) and use lowercase letters for every possible solution.

For example:

```
euler/
├── 1/
│   ├── a.py
│   └── b.py
└── 2/
    ├── a.py
    ├── b.py
    └── c.py
```
