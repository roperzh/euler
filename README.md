## Euler

The idea is to solve a problem from [Project Euler][1] at day.

Since a problem can have many solutions, the idea is to create a folder for every problem using the index of the problem as a folder name (eg `1` for the first problem and `15` for the fifthteen problem) and use lowercase letters for every possible solution.

Every problem folder should have a `problem.md` file with the instructions for the problem.

For example:

```
euler/
├── 1/
│   ├── a.py
│   ├── b.py
│   └── problem.md
└── 2/
    ├── a.py
    ├── b.py
    ├── c.py
    └── problem.md
```
